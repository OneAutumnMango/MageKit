This is my attempt to balance magequit/do what my friends thought of.

I have no experience with modding so apologies if I've done some horrible things

Thank you to the developers for letting people mod this game, check out their discord if you have a chance https://discord.gg/jS5Rsvtp

DO NOT USE THESE MODS FOR ONLINE PLAY WITH RANDOMS. IT CAN CAUSE SOME MAJOR ISSUES.


## How to Install

1. Install BepinEx 5 into your MageQuit directory.
2. Run and then open MageQuit to generate BepinEx files.
3. Build this plugin with `dotnet build` (maybe there will be a prebuild dll in bin).

   If this breaks remove the `CopyToBepInEx` target from the `.csproj` file probably, message `oneautumnmango` on Discord, DO NOT ASK THE MAGEQUIT DISCORD.
4. If you didn't build, you need to copy `bin/Debug/net472/BalancePatch.dll` to `MageQuit/BepInEx/plugins`.
5. Launch the game.

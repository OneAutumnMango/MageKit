This is my attempt to balance magequit/do what my friends thought of.
It now also contains a randomiser for spell attributes if you want that.

I have no experience with modding so apologies if I've done some horrible things (especially the randomiser 💀)

Thank you to the developers for letting people mod this game, check out their discord if you have a chance https://discord.gg/jS5Rsvtp

DO NOT USE THESE MODS FOR ONLINE PLAY WITH RANDOMS. IT CAN CAUSE SOME MAJOR ISSUES.


## How to Install

1. Install [BepinEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.4) into your MageQuit directory.
2. Run and then open MageQuit to generate BepInEx files.
3. Download the latest release here.
4. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file into your MageQuit directory. (should be like `MageQuit/BepInEx/plugins/MageKit.dll`)
5. Launch the game.

MageKit mirror: https://www.nexusmods.com/magequit/mods/2


## How to Use the Randomiser

1. Launch the game (after install)
2. Enter in a seed (letters + numbers)
3. Click `Randomise`
4. Enter into a game.

#### IMPORTANT!! Make sure to reach this before playing:
- You must randomise BEFORE entering a game.
- Ensure EVERYONE you're playing with uses the same seed.
- Once randomised you have to quit MageQuit to randomise again.

## How to Use Boosted (New Gamemode!)

1. Launch the game (after install)
2. Enter into a game.
3. Click `Load Boosted` (DO NOT DO THIS BEFORE OPENING A GAME)

To play a new game after having played one already, click `Unload Boosted` then once youre in the picking screen of the next game `Load Boosted`.

This mode is NOT compatible with the Randomiser.

**Randomiser**:

Added a randomiser to randomise the following:

- Cooldowns (not of recasts)
- Animation WindUp and WindDown
- Spell Velocity
- Damage
- Hitbox Radius
- X and Y Knockback

**Boosted**:

This is a new gamemode where every round you get offered 10 choices to upgrade your spells.
You may select 3 of them.

You can choose to increase or decrease attributes. (Green increase, Red decrease)
You may want to choose decrease for attributes like cooldown or animation windup.

You may choose to ban an upgrade instead to never get it again.
You get one free ban a round.

This mode can be used with the Balance patch but some things may not work. e.g. Geyser winddown might not update according to this patch.


**Debugging**:

- Damage and Healing logged
- Hitboxes for player shown (spells used by others online don't show for you)

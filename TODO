## Spell Rain
spells picked up need:
- additional casts
- dynamic spellbutton
- not crap themselves when you own the spell already (ignore pickup)

start with only melee (+ movement?)


## Misc

### Easy

cap knockback on melee, possibly windup too

reduce jug knockback, more hp less speed?  scale per rounds?

ban some northpull options

nerf petrify, chainmail


### Annoying

let new wormhole be boosted
disable wormhole rpc
make patch toggleable

fix watercannon as jug
